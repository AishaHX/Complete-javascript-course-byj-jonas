//Challenge
/*Code challenge 1*
*Mark and John are trying to compare their MBI (Body mass idex), which is calculated using the formular:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height)
(mass in kg and height in meter)

1.Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables
2 . Calculate both thier BMIs using the formular ( you can even implement both versions)
3 . Create a boolean variable  'markHeigherBMI' containing information about  whether mark has a higher BMI than john.

TEST DATA 1: Marks wights 78 kg and is 1.69m tall.
         john weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall

TEST DATA 2 : Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m  tall.
            john weights 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall

/*Challenge 3

- Two gymnastics tams, Dolphins and Koals.
- they compete against each other 3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins a trophy!

1. Calculate the average score  for each team, using the test data below
2. Compare the team's average score to determine the winner of the competition, and print it to the
winner of the competition, and print it to the console.Don't forgot that there can be a draw, so test for that as well (draw means they have same average score)

3. BONUS 1: Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100. with this rule, a team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, 
and the same time a score of at least 100 points.
HINT : use logical operator to test for minimum score, as well multiple else-if blocks

4 . BONUS 2 : Minimum score also applies to a draw! so a draw only happens when both teams have the same 
score and both have a score greater or greater or equal 100 points. otherwise, no team wins the trophy

TEST DATA : Deolphins score 96 , 108 and 89.
            Koals score 88 , 91 and 110
